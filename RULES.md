# Junk Bots - Card Game Rules

## Turn Order

- Produce Energy
- Use Energy
  (If energy is unused at the end of turn it is lost. The only way around this it store energy in a battery.)
- Idea: Each core has upgrade slots. If you upgrade it, you can put a token there to denote its level. Upgrades do things like produce more energy per turn. Could give you access to something special.
